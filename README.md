# BOOTSTRAP 4
This project is a Social Media UI from a Bootstrap 4 course by @bradtraversy. 

This is the first project in the course. The key lessons I learned building this involved the implementation of a sign up section using the card class and using a modal for the contact.

 ## Tools & Languages:
* HTML5
* CSS (CSS3, Bootstrap 4)
* JavaScript
